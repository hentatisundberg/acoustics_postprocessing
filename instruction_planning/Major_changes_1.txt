Major changes 1

- Add functionality to change coordinate system, as the current one (GPS) is not fit for this geographic area. I want to use the coordinate system SWEREF99. 
- When creating maps, I want to have a matplotlib window opened, so I can pan and zoom in the plot window. I also want a color scale on this map.
- When creating a scatter plot, I want to be able to specify both x and y.
